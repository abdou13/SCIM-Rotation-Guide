1. Install [Framework7](https://framework7.io). This web app requires this framework.

2. If you want to use this web app as a template for a customized version to your program, **fork** this repository first. Then clone the fork as a child folder into your Framework7 directory. It should be at the same level of Framework7's example directory ```dist```. 

3. In a terminal, run ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000``` where 8000 is the port number for quick testing. When you want to kill the server later, type Ctrl+C. There are many other server options to run this such as Apache, Node.js, and nginx. 

4. Open the web app in a browser: http://localhost:8000. Enjoy.
